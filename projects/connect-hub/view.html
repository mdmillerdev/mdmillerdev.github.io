				<p class="view-project-description">The Indian Hill High School Tech Department needed an IT request system for student and teacher use. </p>
				<p class="view-project-description">Using Google AppScript and Google Sheets, I created a solution that included a form to submit requests, a spreadsheet to manage the queue and maintain a history of requests, a database to manage the hardware inventory, and appropriately limited access for the student and teacher volunteers staffing the fulfillment desk. Current inventory is shown on the form and updates upon request fulfillment, enabling users to know prior to submitting a request whether or not it can be fulfilled. When a student borrows hardware and it isn't returned during the day, fulfillment staff can see the location of the student's final class of the day to retrieve the loaned item.</p>
				<p class="view-project-description">The new IT Request System has enabled the Tech Department to quickly and easily track their inventory, enabled students and teachers to rapidly request loaner equipment during the school day, and has given other students real-life work experience staffing the desk during their free period. The tool is still in use today.</p>
